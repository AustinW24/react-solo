# SoundSpace
SoundSpace is an website/app that is mirrored after the music Platform Soundcloud.  This is a clone designed to give you access to similar features such as creating a profile, allowing full CRUD features of posts you make involving audio files/cover art.

**Bugs**
- No Demo User
- Authentication not functional
- Deleting Uploads not functional
- Username for creating uploads takes in a user Id


Future plans include:
  - Continuous Playbar for audio files
  - Creating a profile page and allowing users to follow each other
  - designing a like system that shows on the post
  - Creating pin point comments on the Upload
  - Finish implementing Authorization
